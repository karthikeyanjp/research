## 1. Pre-Purchase Preparation

### 1.1 Financial Readiness Checklist

#### Credit Score
| Score Range | Impact | Action Needed |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 760+ | Best rates, best terms | You're golden |
| 700-759 | Good rates | Minor optimization possible |
| 660-699 | Higher rates (+0.5-1%) | Work on it 3-6 months |
| Below 660 | Subprime territory | Wait and fix credit first |

**DO:**
- ✅ Check your credit report FREE at annualcreditreport.com (all 3 bureaus)
- ✅ Dispute any errors (can take 30-45 days)
- ✅ Pay down credit card balances below 30% utilization
- ✅ Keep old accounts open (length of history matters)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Open new credit cards or loans 6 months before buying
- ❌ Close old credit accounts
- ❌ Make large purchases on credit
- ❌ Co-sign for anyone

#### Savings You Need

| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Down payment | $25K-$50K (5-10% of $500K) | More = better rates, no PMI at 20% |
| Closing costs | $15K-$25K (3-5% of loan) | Title, appraisal, lender fees, escrow |
| Emergency fund | $10K-$15K | Don't empty savings for down payment |
| Moving costs | $2K-$5K | Movers, supplies, utility deposits |
| Immediate repairs | $5K-$10K | Things you'll want to fix/buy |
| **TOTAL RECOMMENDED** | **$60K-$100K** | Before you start looking |

#### Documents to Gather NOW

```
□ Last 2 years of W-2s
□ Last 2 years of tax returns (all pages)
□ Last 2 months of pay stubs
□ Last 2-3 months of bank statements (ALL pages, ALL accounts)
□ Last 2-3 months of investment account statements
□ Government-issued ID
□ Social Security card
□ If self-employed: 2 years of business tax returns + P&L statement
□ If receiving bonus/commission: documentation of last 2 years
□ Gift letter (if using gift money for down payment)
□ Divorce decree (if applicable)
□ Bankruptcy discharge papers (if applicable)
```

### 1.2 Get Pre-Approved (NOT Pre-Qualified)

| Type | What It Means | Weight |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Pre-Qualified** | "Based on what you told us, you might qualify" | Weak, almost meaningless |
| **Pre-Approved** | "We verified your income/credit/assets, you're approved for $X" | Strong, sellers take seriously |

**Get pre-approved by 2-3 lenders** to compare rates. This does NOT commit you to any lender.

---

## 2. Understanding the Players & Their Motivations

### 🎭 Know Who's On Your Side (And Who Isn't)

#### The Seller
**Their Goal:** Get the highest price, fastest close, fewest contingencies

**How They Might Trick You:**
- Hide known defects (illegal but happens)
- Fresh paint/carpet to cover problems
- Strategic timing of showings (hide noise, traffic, neighbors)
- "We have another offer" pressure (may be fake)
- Leaving behind problem items as "bonuses"

**Protect Yourself:**
- Always get independent inspection
- Visit property at different times (morning, night, weekend)
- Talk to neighbors
- Check permit history (unpermitted work = your problem later)

---

#### The Seller's Agent (Listing Agent)
**Their Goal:** Sell the house fast at highest price (they get % of sale price)

**Commission:** Typically 2.5-3% of sale price (paid by seller, but priced into home)

**How They Might Trick You:**
- Downplay problems: "Oh, that's minor"
- Create urgency: "Multiple offers coming in!"
- Steer you away from inspection concerns
- Make verbal promises that aren't in writing

**Remember:** They work for the SELLER, not you. Be polite but guarded.

---

#### Your Buyer's Agent
**Their Goal:** Help you buy (they get paid when you close)

**Commission:** Typically 2.5-3% of sale price (traditionally paid by seller)

**⚠️ NEW IN 2024-2025:** Due to NAR settlement, you may need to sign a buyer's agreement upfront. Negotiate their commission!

**How They Might Mislead You:**
- Push you toward higher-priced homes (bigger commission)
- Rush you to make decisions
- Discourage low offers: "That's insulting, they won't accept"
- Recommend their "preferred" lenders/inspectors (kickback arrangements)
- Downplay issues to close the deal

**DO:**
- ✅ Interview 2-3 agents before choosing
- ✅ Ask about their experience in YOUR price range and area
- ✅ Get references from recent buyers
- ✅ Negotiate commission (2-2.5% is doable in this market)
- ✅ Use YOUR OWN inspector, not their recommendation

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use the seller's agent as "dual agent" (conflict of interest)
- ❌ Sign exclusive agreements longer than 3 months
- ❌ Feel obligated to use their "preferred" vendors

**Questions to Ask a Potential Agent:**
```
1. How many buyers have you helped in the last 12 months?
2. What's your experience in [Allen/specific area]?
3. Can I speak with 2-3 recent clients?
4. What's your commission, and is it negotiable?
5. How will you help me negotiate?
6. What happens if I want to end our agreement?
7. Do you have any financial relationships with lenders/inspectors?
```

---

#### The Lender (Mortgage Company/Bank)
**Their Goal:** Make money from loan origination fees + interest over time

**How They Might Trick You:**
- Quote low "teaser" rate, then higher rate at closing
- Hide fees in the fine print
- Push unnecessary products (mortgage insurance, warranties)
- Bait-and-switch on loan terms
- Pressure to close before you're ready
- "Lock" your rate, then claim it expired

**Types of Lenders:**

| Type | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| Big Banks (Chase, BofA, Wells) | Brand recognition, branches | Less flexible, slower |
| Credit Unions | Lower fees, member-focused | Limited products |
| Mortgage Brokers | Shop multiple lenders for you | Add their own fees |
| Online Lenders (Rocket, Better) | Fast, convenient | Less personal service |
| Local Lenders | Personal service, area knowledge | May have fewer options |

**DO:**
- ✅ Get quotes from 3+ lenders (within 14-day window = counts as one credit inquiry)
- ✅ Compare the **Loan Estimate** document (required by law, standardized format)
- ✅ Ask for the APR, not just the rate (APR includes fees)
- ✅ Get rate lock in writing with expiration date
- ✅ Ask about lender credits vs. points

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Just go with whoever your agent recommends
- ❌ Focus only on monthly payment (they can stretch term to lower payment)
- ❌ Ignore closing cost differences
- ❌ Accept verbal promises — get everything in writing

**Key Terms to Understand:**

| Term | What It Means | Watch Out For |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **APR** | True cost including fees | Compare APR, not just rate |
| **Points** | Prepaid interest (1 point = 1% of loan) | Only worth it if staying 5+ years |
| **Origination Fee** | Lender's processing fee | Negotiate this! |
| **Rate Lock** | Guarantees your rate for X days | Get 45-60 days, not 30 |
| **Escrow** | Lender holds $ for taxes/insurance | Required for <20% down |
| **PMI** | Private Mortgage Insurance | Required if <20% down, adds $200-400/mo |

---

#### The Home Inspector
**Their Goal:** Assess property condition (paid flat fee by you)

**Cost:** $400-$600 for standard inspection

**How They Might Mislead You:**
- Rush through inspection (should take 2-3 hours minimum)
- Miss major issues due to incompetence
- Downplay issues if referred by agent (wants more referrals)
- Not inspect accessible areas: "I couldn't access the attic"

**DO:**
- ✅ ATTEND THE INSPECTION (this is crucial!)
- ✅ Hire your OWN inspector (not agent's recommendation)
- ✅ Check credentials: ASHI or InterNACHI certified
- ✅ Read reviews on Google/Yelp
- ✅ Ask questions during inspection
- ✅ Get specialized inspections if needed (see below)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Skip the inspection to "win" the deal
- ❌ Use a cheap inspector ($200 = red flag)
- ❌ Just read the summary — read the full report

**Additional Inspections to Consider:**

| Inspection | Cost | When Needed |
|------------|------|-------------|
| **Sewer/Septic** | $150-$400 | Always for homes 15+ years old |
| **Foundation** | $400-$600 | Texas clay soil = foundation issues common |
| **Roof** | $200-$400 | If inspector notes concerns |
| **HVAC** | $100-$200 | If system is 10+ years old |
| **Pool** | $150-$300 | If property has pool |
| **Termite/Pest** | $75-$150 | Standard in Texas |
| **Radon** | $150-$200 | Less common in TX but worth it |
| **Mold** | $300-$600 | If any water damage history |

---

#### The Appraiser
**Their Goal:** Determine fair market value (ordered by lender, paid by you)

**Cost:** $500-$750

**What They Do:**
- Compare to recent similar sales ("comps")
- Assess condition and features
- Provide value to lender (protects their investment)

**How This Can Hurt You:**
- **Low appraisal:** Home appraised below purchase price
  - You must pay difference in cash, OR
  - Renegotiate price with seller, OR
  - Walk away (if you have appraisal contingency)

**DO:**
- ✅ Include appraisal contingency in your offer
- ✅ Provide your agent with comps to share with appraiser
- ✅ Ensure home is clean/accessible for appraisal
- ✅ Note any upgrades/improvements

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Waive appraisal contingency (risky!)
- ❌ Try to influence the appraiser directly (illegal)

---

#### The Title Company
**Their Goal:** Ensure clean title transfer, hold escrow funds

**Cost:** $1,500-$3,000 (part of closing costs)

**What They Do:**
- Title search (verify seller owns property, no liens)
- Issue title insurance (protects you from future claims)
- Handle escrow (hold funds until closing)
- Facilitate closing

**How They Can Cause Problems:**
- Miss liens or encumbrances
- Errors in paperwork
- Wire fraud (see scam section)

**DO:**
- ✅ Get owner's title insurance (one-time fee, protects forever)
- ✅ Verify wire instructions by PHONE before sending money
- ✅ Review title commitment for exceptions

## 4. Red Flags & Common Tricks

### 🚨 Home Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Might Hide | Action |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Fresh paint in random spots | Water damage, mold | Ask why, inspect thoroughly |
| Strong air fresheners | Pet odors, smoke, mold | Visit without warning |
| New carpet over concrete | Slab cracks, foundation issues | Get foundation inspection |
| Furniture covering walls | Cracks, damage, holes | Ask to move items |
| No access to attic/crawlspace | Leaks, pests, poor insulation | Require access or walk |
| "As-is" sale | Major hidden problems | Budget for worst case |
| Price way below market | Serious issues, title problems | Investigate thoroughly |
| Seller never lived there (flip) | Cheap/poor quality work | Check permits, inspect extra |
| Utility bills not available | High bills, poor efficiency | Request or walk |
| HOA docs not available | High fees, liens, restrictions | Don't close without them |

### 🚨 Seller Tricks

| Trick | How It Works | Counter |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| "Multiple offers" | Creates urgency, may be fake | Ask for proof, set your max, walk if needed |
| Strategic showing times | Hide traffic, noise, problem neighbors | Visit unannounced at different times |
| Cosmetic staging | Hide flaws, make rooms look bigger | Take measurements, look behind things |
| Delayed disclosure | Reveal problems after you're committed | Include disclosure contingency |
| "Minor" known issues | Downplay serious problems | Get everything in writing, verify |
| Remove/cover survey stakes | Hide property line issues | Get new survey |
| Leave "bonus" items | Dump their junk on you | Specify in contract what stays/goes |

### 🚨 Agent Tricks

| Trick | How It Works | Counter |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Pocket listings | Show you "exclusive" overpriced listings | Search MLS yourself too |
| "Perfect for you" | Push homes that benefit them | Have YOUR criteria in writing |
| Discourage low offers | "They'll be insulted" | Make the offer anyway |
| Rush decisions | "You'll lose it!" | Take your time, another will come |
| Preferred vendors | Kickback arrangements | Use YOUR people |
| After-contract pressure | "Don't rock the boat" | Advocate for yourself |

### 🚨 Lender Tricks

| Trick | How It Works | Counter |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Rate quote games | Quote lower rate than you'll get | Get Loan Estimate in writing |
| Hidden fees | Appear at closing | Compare Loan Estimates from 3+ lenders |
| Rate lock expiration | "Oops, you need to pay more now" | Get adequate lock period (45-60 days) |
| Push unnecessary products | Upsell PMI alternatives, warranties | Decline add-ons, do your research |
| Bait and switch | Change terms after you're committed | Read every document, compare to originals |

### 🚨 SCAM ALERT: Wire Fraud

**This is the #1 real estate scam costing buyers $200K+**

**How It Works:**
1. Scammer hacks email (yours, agent's, or title company's)
2. Sends email with "updated" wire instructions
3. You wire your down payment to scammer's account
4. Money is gone, unrecoverable

**PROTECT YOURSELF:**
```
⚠️ NEVER trust wire instructions sent via email
⚠️ ALWAYS call title company at a number YOU looked up (not from the email)
⚠️ Verify account number verbally before wiring
⚠️ If instructions "change" last minute, STOP and verify
⚠️ Use a password with your title officer for verification
```

## 5. Negotiation Tactics

### Know Your Leverage

| Market Type | Your Leverage | Strategy |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Buyer's Market** (high inventory) | Strong | Offer below asking, ask for concessions |
| **Seller's Market** (low inventory) | Weak | Offer at/above asking, minimize contingencies carefully |
| **Balanced Market** | Moderate | Reasonable offers, standard contingencies |

**Current DFW Market (Jan 2026):** Leaning toward balanced/slight buyer's market (inventory recovering, rates high)

### Offer Strategy

#### Price Negotiation
```
Research-based offering:

1. Get comps (recent sales of similar homes within 0.5 miles)
2. Calculate price per square foot of comps
3. Adjust for differences (upgrades, lot size, condition)
4. Determine fair value range
5. Start below fair value if:
   - Home has been listed 30+ days
   - Price reductions already occurred
   - Seller is motivated (relocation, divorce, estate)
6. Offer at/above fair value if:
   - Multiple offers expected
   - Home is priced well and desirable
   - You really want this specific home
```

#### Beyond Price: Other Negotiation Levers

| Lever | How to Use It |
|-------|---------------|
| **Closing date** | Flexible = more attractive to seller |
| **Earnest money** | Higher = shows seriousness |
| **Contingencies** | Fewer = more attractive (but riskier for you) |
| **Seller credits** | Ask for $5-10K toward closing costs |
| **Repairs** | Request fixes OR credit in lieu of repairs |
| **Home warranty** | Ask seller to pay ($400-600) |
| **Inclusions** | Appliances, fixtures, furniture |
| **Leaseback** | Let seller stay briefly after closing |

### Negotiation Scripts

#### Making an Offer Below Asking
> "Based on recent comparable sales in the area [cite specific addresses and prices], we believe fair market value is $X. We're offering $Y which accounts for [specific issues: needed repairs, dated kitchen, etc.]. We're pre-approved, flexible on closing date, and ready to move quickly."

#### Responding to "We Have Other Offers"
> "Thank you for letting us know. Our offer reflects our maximum based on comparable sales and our financial situation. We're happy to provide proof of pre-approval and can close on your preferred timeline. This is our best offer."

#### Requesting Repairs After Inspection
> "The inspection revealed several issues requiring attention: [list items]. We request the seller either complete these repairs before closing with licensed contractors and provide receipts, or provide a credit of $X at closing to address these items. We're committed to this purchase and want to move forward."

#### Dealing with Low Appraisal
> "The appraisal came in at $X, which is $Y below the contract price. We're unable to pay above appraised value. We propose adjusting the purchase price to $X, or meeting in the middle at $Z with seller providing additional credits toward closing costs."

### The Walk-Away Power

**Your most powerful tool is being willing to walk away.**

- Don't get emotionally attached
- There's always another house
- Set your max price BEFORE making an offer
- If you wouldn't buy it for $X, don't offer $X
- Practice saying: "Thank you, but this doesn't work for us. Best of luck."

### Protest Your Property Taxes (Do This ANNUALLY)

Texas allows you to protest your assessed value. **Do this every year.**

**Timeline:**
- Appraisal notices: April-May
- Protest deadline: May 15 (or 30 days after notice)
- Hearings: May-July

**How to Protest:**
1. File protest online (collincad.org) or by mail
2. Provide evidence:
   - Recent comparable sales lower than your value
   - Photos of condition issues
   - Independent appraisal
3. Attend informal hearing (often settle here)
4. If not satisfied, attend ARB hearing
5. Can appeal to district court if still not satisfied

**Success Rate:** Most people get reductions. It's worth the effort.

### Texas Real Estate Contract Specifics

- Get inspection done during option period

**Earnest Money:**
